# Yeeha - Taipei Tech Course Credit Dashboard

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)

### Getting Started

[clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/yeeha/yeeha.github.io) or [fork](https://github.com/yeeha/yeeha.github.io/fork) the repo:

```shell
$ git clone -o upstream https://github.com/yeeha/yeeha.github.io.git
$ cd yeeha.github.io
$ npm install -g gulp           # Install Gulp task runner globally
$ npm install                   # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
```

### How to Build

```shell
$ gulp build                    # or, `gulp build --release`
```

By default, it builds in debug mode. If you need to build in release mode, add
`--release` flag.

### How to Run

```shell
$ gulp                          # or, `gulp --release`
```

This will start a lightweight development server with LiveReload and
synchronized browsing across multiple devices and browsers.
